# Ideas

    Cool stuff to do > Time to do it
    
I use this repository to [note ideas](https://github.com/peterdesmet/ideas/issues). But instead of just implementing them right away (which is often tempting), I'll let them hatch here for a while to see if they are really worth pursuing. If you would like to collaborate on one, let me know!

## Lists

In case I'm wondering what to do next:

* [My issues](https://github.com/issues)
* [My starred repositories](https://github.com/stars)
